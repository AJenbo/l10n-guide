Firefox
*******

Firefox is the web browser that was born out of the :doc:`mozilla` project. It
is now their default target and is renowned for its security.

This page contains Firefox-specific localisation notes and issues. You should
read this in conjunction with the :doc:`mozilla` pages as there are some things
shared between Firefox and :doc:`thunderbird` localisation.

As stated on the :doc:`mozilla` page, there are more complete instructions
about the requirements and processes involved in Mozilla localisation on the
`Mozilla L10n <https://wiki.mozilla.org/l10n/home_page>`_ project page.

Settings
========

These are configurations not customisations.  These are things that you
**must** change. Remember that you need to go through a formal procedure of
review to commit changes to some of these files in the Mozilla repository,
especially a file like browser/chrome/browser-region/region.properties. This
usually means you need to file a bug, ask for review by setting flags and more
things and put people in CC. Ask at Mozilla for the newest rules.

Foundation builds.
