KDE
***

The KDE Linux desktop is easily localisable and has a very mature localisation
project.

Suggested Priorities
====================

These are the `priorities <http://i18n.skulelinux.no/prioritering.html>`_ as
suggested by the SkuleLinux project.

There is no priority within each of these groups

FIXME this is probably out of date since the move to SVN version control

==========  ===================  =============  ==================

Of course you will probably want to move some applications found in the
kdeextragear modules up.  Or translate them when requested.  Suggested
candidates for bumping up include: amaroK, kbabel, superkaramba, Scribus,
Kopete, Quanta+, Kaffeine, Juk, KDevelop, digiKam, kdebluetooth, kontact and
kimdaba

.. _../pages/guide/kde_desktop#compiling_your_language:

Compiling your language
=======================

FIXME update for SVN

If you have made changes or wish to install the latest translations for your
language from CVS do the following after checking out the kde-i18n module from
CVS.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd kde-i18n
    $ echo XX > inst-apps # Where XX is your language's ISO code
    $ make -f Makefile.cvs
    $ ./configure # or ./configure --prefix=/usr if you do not want files installed is /usr/local
    $ make
    $ su -c "make install"

.. _../pages/guide/kde_desktop#updating_all_translations_manually:

Updating all translations manually
==================================

You can update all translations manually instead of waiting for KDE's automatic
update bot called scripty.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd kde-i18n
    $ cvs up templates
    $ VERBOSE=yes make -f Makefile.am.in merge

If you specify your language in a file called "inst-apps" then it will probably
only update your language, which is a good thing.  Have not checked this
though.

.. _../pages/guide/kde_desktop#committing_to_cvs:

Committing to CVS
=================

FIXME fix for SVN

Always check the PO files by running:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd kde-i18n
    $ check_po_files xx

Where xx is your language code.  Also running msgfmt in check mode

.. code-block:: bash

    $ msgfmt --check -o /dev/null some-file.po

.. _../pages/guide/kde_desktop#checking_accelerators:

Checking accelerators
=====================

You now need to add the following to your kdeglobals in order to use the
:kbd:`F12` accelerator check feature:

.. code-block:: ini

    [Development]
    CheckAccelerators=F12
