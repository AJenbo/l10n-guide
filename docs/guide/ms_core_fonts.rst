Microsoft's Core Fonts
**********************

An unfortunate legacy of the browser wars is that many sites are designed
specifically for Microsofts Internet Explorer and more importantly are designed
around a few Microsoft specific fonts.  Fortunately Microsoft released these
fonts gratis on the web.  Note however, that the Tahoma font does require a
valid Windows License.

Installation instructions
=========================

The `corefonts <http://corefonts.sourceforge.net/>`_ project has links to the
required files and instructions for building and installing the fonts on Linux.

Windows users without these fonts can simply `download
<http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=34153&package_id=56408>`_
the required files.
