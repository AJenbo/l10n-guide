Translating Example Paths and URLs
**********************************

A path shows you where a file is located on your computer ::

  /home/dwayne/somefile.doc
  c:\Windows\Desktop\somefile.doc
  \\Server\share\somefile.doc

A URL is similar but relates to files located on the Internet ::

  http://www.google.com
  ftp://someserver.com/file/to/download.zip

In translatable messages you will find real paths and URLs but you will also
find instances where the author is giving the user an example. 

.. _../pages/guide/translation/paths_urls#simple_policy:

Simple Policy
=============

Want a simple policy on what to do with URLs (example or real)?

**Do not translate ANY paths, URLs or URIs**

.. _../pages/guide/translation/paths_urls#system_directories:

System directories
==================

Many operating systems contain system directories, these are directories used
by the operating system itself.  System directories will not change even when
your language changes.  The following are system directories on Linux and
should not be translated::

  /home
  /mnt
  /usr
  /etc
  /bin
  /sbin

The following are system directories on Windows and should also not be translated::

  C:\Windows
  C:\Windows\System

.. _../pages/guide/translation/paths_urls#home_directories:

Home directories
================

On Linux systems each user has a home directory which corresponds to their
username and is usually located under /home eg. /home/fred.  The word **home**
should not be translated because it is a system directory.  But the username
should be translated.  You should probably keep the username to ASCII
characters (some operating systems cannot use Unicode in filename) and thus
romanise the name if you needed.

.. _../pages/guide/translation/paths_urls#extensions:

Extensions
==========

A file is made up of the:

+------------+-----------------------+
| fullname   | /the/path/to/file.doc |
+============+=======================+
| path       | /the/path/to/         |
+------------+-----------------------+
| filename   | file.doc              |
+------------+-----------------------+
| basename   | file                  |
+------------+-----------------------+
| extension  | doc                   |
+------------+-----------------------+

The file extension is thus the characters that appear after the last fullstop
in a filename.  You do not translate the file extension but you do translate
the basename.  Eg. budget.doc -- Translate **budget** but do not translate
**.doc**.

.. _../pages/guide/translation/paths_urls#examples:

Examples
========

Often examples can be identified because they involve saving a file from within
an application. Eg,  "Save the picture to /home/dwayne/picture/snapshot.png"
You will want to translate dwayne, picture and snapshot.  You would not
translate home because that is a system directory nor png because it is an
extension.

.. _../pages/guide/translation/paths_urls#urls:

URLs
====

A URL is made up of these components ::

  protocol :// server : port / directorie(s) / filename . extension

Here is a real URL, i.e. one that you would actually use::

  http://www.translate.org.za/downloads/openoffice.org-afrikaans.tar.gz

you should not translate it unless you needed to point to a version of the URL
that is in your language.

This is an example URL, i.e. one used as an example to a user::

  http://example.com/directory/filename.html

you would translate: example, directory and filename.

You would **not** translate:

+--------+---------------------------------------------------+
| http   | the protocols are not translatable                |
+--------+---------------------------------------------------+
| .com   | top level doamns are also not translatable        |
+--------+---------------------------------------------------+
| .html  | is a file extension and therefore not translated  |
+--------+---------------------------------------------------+
