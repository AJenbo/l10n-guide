.. _../pages/guide/translation/problem_words#programming_languages:

Programming languages
=====================

You will often see text that relates to programming or programming like
languages.  Some of them you can change.

* Spreadsheet functions -- you can translate these if they make sense
* Program syntax -- never translate as this is the grammar of a programming
  language
* SQL -- you should never change this unless the program is providing some user
  interface that will hide people from the actual SQL language.

.. _../pages/guide/translation/problem_words#do_translate:

Do translate
------------

* Many people cannot read Latin characters so the words and names will appear
  meaningless
* You don't need to think about whether this is or isn't translatable

.. _../pages/guide/translation/problem_words#dont_translate:

Don't translate
---------------

* Think of it as another language, you have to learn the language of the
  spreadsheet
* Outside of your application people will see only the English so if you
  translate it will confuse them
* If people work in a multilingual environment its better to leave it
  untranslated becauase you don't want them to struggle when they can't
  remember the Afrikaans naam for SUM()
