Capitalisation
**************

What should you do about capitals that you see in the English source
translations?  You will notice that English makes use of *Title Case*:

Note how almost every word starts with a capital letter.  This is a style often
used in English software, especially for titles, buttons and menus. This is
also sometimes called "header capitalisation"

What do you do in your language?

Choosing your style
===================

The first thing to remember is that you should be adapting the software to the
conventions of your culture and language.  You do not need to slavishly follow
English title case.  By all means if your language follows this convention then
use it.  But if is doesn't, then please use the normal case style used in your
language.  Very few languages actually use the style of title case as much as
English do. Rather just follow the normal rules for capitalisation in your
language.

Starting capitals or the lack thereof
=====================================

You will notice that certain sentences do not start with a capital.  Try to
match these capitals as they are often done for a reason.  Sometimes they
represent phrases that will be joined at runtime (this is a bad practice and
should be reported to the programmer for correction).

To check your starting capitals use :ref:`toolkit:pofilter` ::

  pofilter -t startcaps input output

What to do with 'OK'
====================

In English the **``OK``** or affirmative button is all in capitals.  It is thus
tempting to provide a fully capitalised translation in Xhosa that woul dbe
**``KULUNGILE``**.  But this looks strange.  Rather abandon the English
capitals and use normal capitalisation for your translation ie
**``Kulungile``**
