Casual Translations
*******************

Computers are rather formal.  In fact if they were too friendly we wouldn't
enjoy using them.  You don't expect a computer to talk to you as a friend you
expect it to give you the information you need with the minimum of fuss and
then get out of the way:

We prefer:
  The file could not be found

To:
  That file that you were looking for I can't seem to find it.  Help!

In your translations you have the opportunity of removing language that is too
casual.  Be careful when translating games and kiddies programs as you might
want to keep informal language.

Here is a snippet of an email from Malcolm Hunter -- one of the British English
translator.  You might want to take note of his points and remove these from
your translations.

    Something I've forgotten to mention:

    There was discussion sometime ago about use of first person and casual/
    IRC-style usage. As much as possible can we try to make the wording more 
    professional.

    1. I, me, my should be avoided, unless it is the user's response (eg. "Let me 
    choose") and can't easily be changed to something else. The program shouldn't 
    be saying to the user: "I was unable to...", etc.

    2. We is another one, there are 2 examples of this in kget.po ("We are 
    online / offline") - who's "We"? I'm not sure what to do with these at the 
    moment - depends on the context.

    3. The program should not apologise - there is a Sorry function, but the 
    actual text shouldn't have the word "Sorry" in it. I'm not sure about 
    "Please" either.

    4. No IRC emoticons, abbreviations (eg. LOL) - we might get developers 
    moaning, but at the end of the day these apps are being used by corporate 
    users as well.

    5. Same goes for casual, conversational wording (eg. "Oops!" which I recently 
    found in a dialog title bar). Same reason as item 4.

    With games and amusements where the target user-base is mainly home, we can be 
    a bit more relaxed with this as we don't want to spoil the fun aspect.

    Thanks,
    Malcolm
