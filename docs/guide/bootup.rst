Direction setting based on the installation and bootup process
**************************************************************

This document looks at the whole Linux installation and bootup process with
these main sections:

- Installation
- Booting
- Init 5 (GUI)
- Init 3 (Text)

The bootup and installation process are very visual and give a user the first
impression of the level of localisation in their software. If we can give them
a good impression with less work then it becomes easier to create a fully
translated Linux distribution.

The idea is to layout the dependencies and try place translatable components in
some relative order in the process.  This is done so that we for instance can
place the language locale file at the correct point in the bootup process. And
thus at the correct point at which it becomes important to a localisation
project.

FIXME This document is based on Fedora but probably applies to any Linux
distribution.

Post Booting
============

The booting process will take a computer to the place where the user is
required to login.  This section looks at what items are seen just after the
user logs in.

.. _../pages/guide/bootup#post_booting_init_5:

Init 5
------

* Wallpaper (if different from login wallpaper)
* Fedora -- menu's
* GNOME / KDE

  * Kicker
  * K Menu bar general
  * Clock
  * Desktop

.. _../pages/guide/bootup#post_booting_init_3:

Init 3
------

* /etc/issue not really possible to change easily

.. _../pages/guide/bootup#config_tools:

Config Tools
============

Once logged in a user will interact with the standard Free and Open Source
applications that are usually localised outside of the distribution community.
However each distribution has its own set of configuration tools that need
localisation.

FIXME Create some category of which configuration tools are more important to
localise then others.

On Fedora all the user centric and hardware related system-config tools
constiture 7691 words of translation.
