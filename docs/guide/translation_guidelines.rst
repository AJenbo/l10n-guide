Translation Guidelines
**********************

What is the policy for translating acronyms in my language?  Should I use Title
Case?  These are all issues that should be addressed in a translation
guidelines or policy document.  Some of these already exist but are usually
project specific.  This page and template are a space for you to develop a
policy document for your language.

The :doc:`translation_guidelines_template` is designed to be a basis from which
to develop your languages guidelines.  If you see that you re adding a new
section to your policy first check to see if its in the template.  If not then
please add it. We want the template to be a model of what issues people should
be considering.  The policy document is yours -- make it do what you need it to
do.
