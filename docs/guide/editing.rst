Editing the Localisation Guide
******************************

We would like you to contribute the knowledge you have to make this guide more
comprehensive.  The main aim of the guide is to reduce the pain experienced by
most localisers in finding the correct information on specific project and in
contributing for the first time.

Please add your wisdom and help save others from experiencing your pain.

First things first
==================

Please familiarise yourself with the guide so that you are aware if any of the
content you want to add is already present.  We don't want to duplicate
information because if we do:

- The information become dated and disagrees across the different sections
- We're trying to make a guide that is as general and only specific when needed
  and then only where needed

.. _../pages/guide/editing#what_goes_where:

What goes where
===============

The wiki contains some distinct sections:

- The guides to the Translate Toolkit
- This guide -- the localisers guide
- A glossary of localisation terms

Each of these make use of namespaces to distinguish sections from each other.
Please make sure you are editing in the right place.

The localiser guide is broken down into the following broad sections:

* Running a localisation project in general
* Information specific to the major localisation projects
* Guides for translators that cut across all projects
* Hints for developers so that they can help localisers

Please place content in the relevant section.  Please don't duplicate content
but rather link to the relevant section in the other parts of the guide.

.. _../pages/guide/editing#headings:

Headings
========

Generally each page has an H1 heading and all other headings are below that.
Please make use of section headings for clarity (it also makes it possible for
others to link to your sections).  Also use high level headings starting from
H1 in your document as this then creates the nice table of contents
automatically.

.. _../pages/guide/editing#style:

Style
=====

We are not that particular about the style of writing (well we haven't seen any
awful stuff yet). But please do stay to the point and feel free to give
personal examples and to use personal pronouns.  Eg "we have found that". The
guide text is quite formal but if you need to, then add humour as needed.

.. _../pages/guide/editing#spelling_and_grammar:

Spelling and Grammar
====================

Firstly I can't spell!  We also realise that some contributors are not native
English speakers so don't worry too much about that -- or ask someone on
translat-devel@lists.sourceforge.net to check you spelling and grammar.  The
main idea is that it be understandable. Ask yourself, "Would this help me learn
something, start something or start contributing?"  If the answer is "Yes.",
then your content is probably good enough.

.. _../pages/guide/editing#licensing:

Licensing
=========

This guide is under a creative commons license.  Please be aware of that before
adding your content and be aware that copy and paste might violate someone
elses copyright -- rather write from scratch or paraphrase the documents you
want to copy.

.. _../pages/guide/editing#credit:

Credit
======

Everyone wants credit. Please add your name to the credits page.

.. _../pages/guide/editing#using_namespaces:

Using Namespaces
================

The guide makes extensive use of namespaces, e.g.
``translation/variables.html`` refers to the variables page in the translation
section of this guide.

.. _../pages/guide/editing#adding_another_language_or_translating:

Adding another language or translating
======================================

FIXME

Please make use of namespaces to separate your translations from the main
document.  Use your languages iso639 code as the namespace.  For Zulu this page
would be referred to as ::
