Glossary
********

Note: many of the terms use an abbreviation of the form x10y where 10 stands
for the number of letters between the first letter x and the last letter y
(e.g. l10n)

a12n
  see Africanisation

a11y
  see Accessibility

Accessibility
  This is the effort to make software device independent, for input, output,
  and "display".  this includes screen reading software, devices controlled by
  brain waves, and everything in between. This effort is mostly aimed at
  ensuring that computers and devices are usable by people with disabilities.

Africanisation
  Any activity that assists with the localisation and globalisation of software
  for the African continent.

CAT
  Computer Aided Translation.  Any one of a number of tools that assist
  translators during translation.

CLDR
  see Common Locale Data Repository

Common Locale Data Repository
  this is an effort to provide a unifies locale data repository, thus merging a
  number of separate efforts.  They have also defined an XML standard for
  storing locale data seems to be much more flexible then current methods.

fuzzy translation
  This has two meanings:

  #. In Gettext translation: any string that has been modified or guessed by
     the Gettext tools ie a piece of text that needs your review.
  #. In the localisation industry: a fuzzy string is an attempt to match the
     untranslated string with information from a TM.  Usually this is expressed
     as a percentage eg 80% match.

g11n
  see Globalisation

Gettext
  A set of tools used primarily on Linux and Unix computers that makes a
  program translatable.  The toolset provides tools to extract messages from
  programs, to manipulate the translations, to compile the translations and to
  allow a program to appear translated when it is run.

Globalisation

i18n
  see Internationalisation

Internationalisation
  this is the process of making a program localisable.  This would cover work
  to allow for different fonts and character sets to be displayed correctly.
  To allow for scripts that run from right-to-left, etc.  This work is usually
  done once for a language, once the toolkits and programs support a language
  the internationalsiation work is usually complete.

l10n
  see Localisation

l12y
  see Localisability

l18n
  see either i18n or l10n.  This is a common misspelling of one of
  these words.

Locale
  this is a file that defines the locale data for your language and country.  A
  locale covers things such as: the names of months and days of the week, how
  to write dates in your language, how your write number and currency values,
  the sort order of your language and much else.  This data is essential for a
  computer to support your language.

Localisation
  This is the process of taking an existing program or operating system and
  making it work in your language.  This would include translating: interface
  and documentation, creating a locale file and the creation of fonts.  It
  would not include changing the widget set or program operation to cater for
  your language, that work would fall under internationalisation.

Localisability
  This is the degree to which a program can be localized -- for example, fixed
  strings in a program that cannot be translated would be a localisability
  issue

m17n
  Multilingualization

Machine Translation
  when a machine translates from one language to another.  You might also hear
  of Machine Assisted Translation, this is where a machine does the initial
  translation usually drawing heavily on a Translation Memory and a human
  translator does the final approval and correction.

MO
  Machine Object file.  This is the result of compiling a PO file using
  Gettext's msgfmt command.  MO file are used because they are much quicker for
  a computer to read then PO files.

MT
  see Machine Translation

Multilingualization
  This has one several different usages:

  - The UI has a user selectable choice of languages.
  - The user can input data in a number of different languages.
  - The user can select the output in a number of different languages.

PO
  Portable Object file.  These are the files produced by xgettext (cf.) that a
  translator translates into their language.  These files are compiled using
  Gettext (cf.) tools into an MO file (cf.)

PO Editor
  Any one of a number of tools that can edit PO files.  PO files are plain text
  files and in most cases a PO editor will hide the complexity from the
  translator and provide extra features like translation memory, etc.

TEnT
  Translation Environment Tool.  A term suggested by some (Jost Zetzsche) as an
  alternative to CAT (cf.).

TM
  see Translation Memory

TMX
  see Translation Memory Exchange format

Translation Memory Exchange format
  TMX allows you to export, import and thus exchange translation memory data
  between various CAT tools.

Translation Memory
  to reuse existing translations you make use of a TM.  It makes translation
  faster but also ensures the translations remain consistent.

Unicode
  This is a standard that is able to represent all characters for all alphabets
  in one character set.  By doing this you are able to display any all and any
  character or language on one page.  Unicode only provides the encoding you
  would still need fonts to display the text.

UI
  User Interface

UTF-8
  A method of encoding Unicode using 8 bits.  Other methods include UTF-7,
  UTF-16 and UTF-32. UTF-8 is the most dominant method of encoding Unicode
  characters, but UTF-16 is becoming more common.

XLIFF
  A new file format for representing translation data.  It provides much more
  useful features then any current format and you will see this become more
  widely adopted in future.

xgettext
  a program which is part of the Gettext (cf.) tools that extracts translatable
  content from programs and stores them in a PO (cf.) files that will be
  translated by a translator.
