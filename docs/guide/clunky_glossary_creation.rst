Clunky method to create glossaries
**********************************

.. note::
    A newer tool called :ref:`toolkit:poterminology` is now part of the
    `Translate Toolkit <http://toolkit.translatehouse.org>`_ and should work
    better for all users. This page is only left for reference.

This old method is for Windows users, but the principles can be applied in
Linux as well.  It is for creating a subject specific glossary in a specific
software translation project.  The idea is to get a list of commonly used
jargon from the project that can be translated beforehand.

.. _../pages/guide/clunky_glossary_creation#1._extract_the_source_text:

1. Extract the source text
==========================

Take the PO file and do :ref:`po2csv <toolkit:po2csv>` on it::

  po2csv file.po file.csv

Open the CSV file in Excel or Calc.

Copy the "original" (or "source") column into a text editor, like `Babelpad
<http://www.babelstone.co.uk/Software/BabelPad.html>`_, and save the file as
text.txt.

.. _../pages/guide/clunky_glossary_creation#2._extract_commonly_occurring_words:

2. Extract commonly occurring words
===================================

Use `ExtPhr32 <http://publish.uwo.ca/~craven/freeware.htm>`_ to extract the
most used terms from it:

* Do not select a stoplist (click "Cancel" when asked)
* Go :menuselection:`Options --> Minimum occurrences`, and select "1"
* Go :menuselection:`Options --> Maximum words in phrase`, and select "1"
* Go :menuselection:`File -> Extract from`, and select the file with source
  text

* In ExtPhr, change the "Minimum occurrences" higher and higher until you have
  about 200 terms (or, about 5 occurrences should do it).

* Save the result as 5ormore.txt.

.. _../pages/guide/clunky_glossary_creation#3._create_general_common_words_list:

3. Create general common words list
===================================

Create a file containing the 3000 most used words in English.  I used Ogden's
850 words, plus the 3000 words, adjectives, adverbs and pronouns from `here
<http://www.paulnoll.com/Books/Clear-English/>`_, but you could use `Kevin's
lists <http://wordlist.sourceforge.net/>`_ as well (actually, that would be
better because then you could legally distribute it).

.. _../pages/guide/clunky_glossary_creation#4._remove_general_words_from_extracted_common_words_list:

4. Remove general words from extracted common words list
========================================================

Use `Kastrul <http://www.esaro.se/index2.php?LANG=en>`_ to spellcheck the
"5ormore.txt":

* Go :menuselection:`File --> Open dictionary`, and select your 3000 most
  common words.
* Go :menuselection:`File --> Check file`, and select 5ormore.txt
* Copy the result, and save it as glossary.txt.

That is your glossary.  Remember to change it all to lowercase, and to ensure
that dud words are removed.
